# Jumpdrive

A swiss army knife for mobile devices, currently supporting:

- Pine64 PineTab
- Pine64 PinePhone
- Purism Librem 5
- Xiaomi Pocophone F1
- OnePlus 6
- OnePlus 6T

You can use this to flash a image **directly to eMMC**, troubleshooting a broken system, and a lot more.

### Installation
Download the latest image for your device [here](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases)


#### PinePhone / PineTab

Then use dd to flash the image to an SD card. Jumpdrive is pretty small, so there is no need for a large storage SD card.

Insert the SD card to the device, then boot it up, you should get a nice splash screen and you should see a new storage device after you plug the device to USB.

With the device plugged in, you can now flash a distro, fix an unbootable installation or only charge quickly your PinePhone using the image pine64-pinephone-charging.img.

**WARNING:**
In case eMMC isn't showing up try to charge your battery and try again. There are reports of people not being able to flash to eMMC with discharged battery.

#### Librem 5

Extract the downloaded JumpDrive release archive for the Librem 5, put the device into flash mode, then run the `boot-purism-librem5.sh` script from the release.

### Xiaomi Pocophone F1 / OnePlus 6 / OnePlus 6T

Boot the image using `fastboot boot`.
