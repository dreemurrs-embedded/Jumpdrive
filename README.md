# Jumpdrive

The swiss army knife of Pine64 devices (currently only Pinetab and PinePhone)

You can use this to flash a image **directly to eMMC**, troubleshooting a broken system, and a lot more.

### Installation
Download the latest image for your device [here](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases)

Then use dd to flash the image to an SD card. Jumpdrive is pretty small, so there is no need for a large storage SD card.

Insert the SD card to the device, then boot it up, you should get a nice splash screen and you should see a new storage device after you plug the device to USB.

With the device plugged in, you can now flash a distro, or fix a unbootable installation.

**WARNING:**
In case eMMC isn't showing up try to charge your battery and try again. There are reports of people not being able to flash to eMMC with discharged battery.
